# ‚òï Ficticious Coffee Shop Sales Analytics

A beginner-friendly data analytics portfolio project using **Excel**, **SQL (MySQL)**, **Python** and **Power BI**.  
The dataset comes from [Maven Analytics ‚Äì Coffee Shop Sales](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?dataSet=coffee-shop-sales) (also available on Kaggle). It contains transactional data from a fictional chain of coffee shops, including dates, times, locations, products, quantities, and prices.

## üéØ Project Goal

Answer simple but realistic business questions about a coffee shop chain:

1. **When are stores busiest?** (by hour, weekday, and location)  
2. **What sells best?** (top products and categories by revenue and quantity)  
3. **What is the Average Order Value (AOV)?** (overall and by location/time)  

These questions are easy to understand without domain expertise, and they demonstrate core analytics skills.
